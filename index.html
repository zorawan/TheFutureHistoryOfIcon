        <h3>The floppy disk</h3>

        <p class="Intro">Imagine embarking on a journey to explore the evolution of user interface design over time. A
            journey that takes you back to the good old days when the floppy disk icon was the universal symbol for
            saving
            files. This iconic icon was an essential element in early user interface design and was universally
            recognized.
            Designers had to work with it to deliver an explicit affordance for the "save" button.
            However, the floppy disk icon has disappeared from most user interfaces with the advent of newer and more
            advanced ways of saving files. But the journey doesn't end here. We explore the impact of this transition on
            user experience and how designers have adapted to the changing times. Together, we'll discover how icons
            shape
            the user experience over time and hopefully predict these selected icons' future.</p>

        Based on our survey data, the 25-34 age group comprises the majority of participants, accounting for

        Universal icons which do not pass the user testing
    </h3>
    <p>
        The interpretation of these four icons varies due to their multiple uses, making it difficult to obtain
        consistent answers. Their versatility is context-dependent. It is possible that, in the future, one dominant
        meaning for each icon may emerge, overshadowing its other uses.

                    <p>The icon represents the absence of agreement in the survey concerns for several reasons. It's
                        possible that it's not widely recognized or that people are indifferent to its meaning. This is
                        consistent with the findings of WebAIM. This non-profit organization analyzed home pages and
                        found that 96.3% failed to meet WCAG 2 standards.</p>

        <h3 class="quote" id="quote1">The assumption that a universal icon will always be universally understood may
            not
            hold
            true,
            as the presence of obsolete objects can impact people's comprehension of digital interfaces.</h3>

        <h3 class="quote-invert">Opinions on icons may vary across different generations, such the
            evolving understanding and interpretation of icons will influence the icon usage. Icons recognized by
            younger
            generations may have a greater potential for longevity.</h3>

        <h3 class="quote" id="quote2">Keep the inclusiveness in mind when designing and using icons.</h3>
